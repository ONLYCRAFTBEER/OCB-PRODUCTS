<p>A light-golden, cloudy haze and pillowing foam please the eye while the aroma bursts with tropical, juicy delight. We added a mountain of Australian hops to this one, garnering a rich bouquet of peach, mango, grapefruit and pineapple.¬†</p>
<p>Vegan friendly & all natural - free of preservatives and additives.</p> <p>Tasting Notes:</p> <p>Crisp mouthfeel with a moderate degree of clarity.

<p>We know you’ve heard it before, but here at Aether, we’re genuinely dedicated to doing things differently. Inspired by the word ‘quintessence’ or the mysterious fifth element, Aether Brewing cultivates this unknown essence in the magic we bring to our beer, ginger beer and seltzer range.</p>
<p>Aether Brewing is wholly-owned by Dave and Annie Ward and backed by their amazing families. Being independent and family-owned means we have the freedom to experiment, and can cultivate a workplace that really doesn’t feel like work.</p>
<p>For us, creativity is our passion, and this year we’re diving headfirst into some really exciting long term commitments to supporting the Australian arts community. Creativity, community, authenticity, quality, and balance are the five core pillars or values that help guide us in everything that we do…</p>
<p><span>Here at Aether Brewing, creativity is what enables our personal fulfilment, but also our existence and growth as a brewery. We’re lucky enough to express ourselves by brewing and sharing our craft beers with the good folk of Australia, and beyond!</span></p><p> </p><p>Brewery Liquor Licence:</p>203202 <p> Please note, that this product cannot be delivered to Dry Zones and PO boxes.

We have collaborated with one of the Six and of the longest serving surfboard manufacturers in Australia, Bennett Surfboards, who since 1956 has been the beacon of innovation amongst the surfing community.</p>
<p>We take inspiration from the forward-thinking philosophy of Bennett's.</p>
<p><strong>Tasting Notes:</strong></p><p>We have shaped a refreshing, well-balanced lager with a unique twist. Using NZ hop Nelson Sauvin, a hop that was a little innovator itself with its unique Sauvignon Blanc and gooseberry characters, we pay homage to those who can take something seemingly relevantly every day and elevate it to new heights.
Our Pintail Lager does just that.</p><p><strong>Beer type:Lager</strong></p><p>ABV:4.2%</p><p>IBU:15</p><p><strong>About the brewery</strong></p><p>Everything we do at SurfCraft is a creative collaboration between the beer and surf industry.

<p>Inspired by the Brookvale Six and the history of surfing on the Northern Beaches, the Six are largely credited to starting the surf industry and bringing modern surfing to Australia. Together, they ended up producing 90 percent of Australia‚Äôs surfboards and with the help of cheaper rent they turned Brookvale into the nation's surfing capital - Surf City.</p>
<p>The Brookvale Six were no strangers to a beer or two, either, and used to rotate beer duties so they could enjoy a keg of the good stuff at knockoff. This tradition was held every friday after blowing foam all week in the factories. Here at SurfCraft we have decided it's high time this area reforged the link between the two types of foam that have put us on the map. Our mission is to unite the worlds of shaping beers and crafting boards has led to SurfCraft, a beer label inspired by the style and spirit of the Northern Beaches surf culture.</p><p>Brewery Liquor Licence:LIQW880015521</p> <p> Please note, that this product cannot be delivered to Dry Zones and PO boxes.

It was in the Keyo Factory along with many crafting hands that the game changing Vee Bottom came to life, giving surfers the shape they needed to carve a tighter, shorter arc on the wave creating a new movement (sounds like our beer).</p>
<p>Our Vee Bottom Session Ale waves the Keyo flag for innovation using an incredibly new and exciting hop from NZ Hops, NZH-102.

At the beginning of 2019 things we're amped up with the addition of a new brewer and a few other legends joining the team to take the brand beyond the brewery taproom. 
Lost Palms Brewing Co. name and branding has been inspired by beer as an experience - we believe that beer is an experience and the favorite experiences that come to mind when thinking of beers are holidays and escaping the regimented life. That's why our motto is Get Lost; in the moment, in the time, with yourself or with others. Take a second to enjoy your beer and emerge yourself in tropical quenching flavors and your surroundings. Lost Palms embraces our neighborhood by playing off classic Miami Vice colours and vibe with the use of pastels and bright retro colours. At Lost Palms the goal is to supply the local area with quality fresh local beer, beer for here from here, we do this by only working with other local businesses and engaging with the local community.</p><p>Brewery Liquor Licence:190552</p> <p> Please note, that this product cannot be delivered to Dry Zones and PO boxes.
